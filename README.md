## Overview
This project is aimed at providing insightful analysis of the Amazon sales data for a Company. The analysis is presented through a comprehensive dashboard created in Microsoft Excel using pivot tables and charts.

## Data Source
The sales data used for this analysis is sourced from a CSV file provided by a Company on the internet. The data includes information such as dates, locations, sales amount, profits, categories, sub-categories, product names and customer details.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
Before analysis, the raw data underwent several preprocessing steps:

. Imported the data from a CSV file into Excel.  
. Utilized the "Text to Columns" feature to ensure proper data formatting.  
. Removed blanks and duplicates to maintain data integrity.  
. Created separate columns for year and month from the date column for time-based analysis.  
. Truncated the product name column for better visualization and readability.

## Dashboard Components
The dashboard consists of multiple tabs, each focusing on different key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualizations:

. Product Performance: Analyzes the performance of individual products, including sales amount, quantity sold, profit margins, and sales by sub-categories.  
. Customer Analysis: Explores customer demographics and count of customers.  
. Most Profitable Products: Identifies the most profitable products based on sales.  
. Monthly Trends: Visualizes sales trends on a monthly basis, enabling seasonal and trend analysis.
